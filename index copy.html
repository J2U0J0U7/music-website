              FUTURE is the fifth album by Atlanta rapper Future. It was released on February 17, 2017. The self-titled
              album was announced by Future through social media on February 14, 2017, along with the option to
              pre-order and tour dates for the Nobody Safe Tour.

              The original release of FUTURE contained 17 featureless tracks that spanned just over an hour.

              In June of 2017, Future added “Used To This”, the official “Mask Off” Remix, and “Extra Luv” to the
              album’s tracklist.

              On July 14th, 2017, the album was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America,
              with over 1 million certified sales.

              It also made the #15 spot on Billboard’s US Top 200 Year End 2017 chart, making it the 15th best
              performing album that year.

              High Off Life is Future’s eighth studio album and the follow-up to January 2019’s The WIZRD.

              On July 12, 2019, Future released the album’s lead single, “100 Shooters.” Eleven days later, Future
              released another single, “Undefeated.” Its cover used a similar aesthetic to “Shooters,” but it was only a
              promotional single.

              The second single, “Last Name,” was released on November 15.

              On January 10, 2020, Future released the record’s third single, “Life Is Good,” which was a notable
              reunion with Drake. After a successful debut, the song received an official remix a month later, adding
              Lil Baby and DaBaby to the track. The remix serves as the fourth single.

              The fifth and final pre-release single, “Tycoon,” was released on April 1.

              All of the five pre-release singles were listed at the end of the album, so the first sixteen tracks are
              the true album while the five singles are bonus tracks.

              On April 7, 2020, XXL published their interview with Future for their Spring 2020 issue. Future initially
              stated that Life Is Good was the album’s title. He also described its creative process and what the album
              meant to him.

              On May 12, 2020, DJ ESCO, the album’s executive producer, officially announced the LP by posting its
              tracklist on his Instagram. This revealed that the album’s title had been changed to High Off Life. Hours
              later, Future confirmed the album via a tweet, and he also posted the official artwork

              Rappers Drake and Future collaborated on a mixtape titled "What a Time to Be Alive," which was released on
              September 20, 2015.

              Metro Boomin produced the majority of the project, with help from Southside, Boi-1da, Noah "40" Shebib,
              and other producers. Metro's production served as the impetus for the now-famous Future line, "If Young
              Metro don't trust you, I'm going to shoot you," which debuted on "Jumpman."


              The tape was both Drake and Future's second album to debut at number one in 2015 (Future with DS2, and
              Drake with If You're Reading This It's Too Late). The tape opened at number one on the Billboard 200.

                I NEVER LIKED YOU is Future’s ninth studio album, the follow-up to his May 2020 album, High Off Life.

                Speculations began during an Instagram Story in January 2022, in which Future is seen working in their
                first join since 2019 with his most frequent collaborator, Metro Boomin, quoting:

                back 2 the basics @future

                On February 11, Future released his first 2022 single, “Worst Day,” for Valentine’s Day, making it the
                first promotional single for the album.

                On April 4, Future hyped his fans with a tweet, saying that his frequent collaborator and Freebandz
                member, Young Scooter told him that he should release his next album on the same month — Later on the
                same
                day, he posted another tweet about the album, saying that new music would be coming very soon.

                The next day during an Instagram Story, Scooter teased a short-clip of a new Kanye West collaboration
                with
                Future, and later, he responds on his own Instagram Story, confirming that the collaboration will be on
                his album, saying:

                Ima have album date this week jus holdup .. YE SPAZZED ON DIS SHIT.

                On April 7 and 8, Future took Twitter to confirm that Babyface Ray and FKA twigs would also be featured
                on
                his new album, alongside that he would announce the date and name of the album soon in another tweet.

                On April 13, Future would post on Instagram that his new album would be coming out on April 29, 2022,
                with
                the title still not released to the public.

                On April 25, 2022, Future announced in Instagram the title and album cover of the album — The cover is
                part of Future’s photo shoot for an interview with GQ on April 19.

                The next day, Future confirms “KEEP IT BURNIN” with Ye in a short clip of the video on Instagram, that
                would appear on the album — the song was first seen during the official Tracklist for Kanye West’s
                album,
                Donda 2, and an unfinished version of the song appeared on Ye’s Stem Player, later was removed from the
                song list.

                Future revealed on Instagram the official tracklist of the album on April 27, with features of Gunna,
                Young Thug, Drake, Tems, Kanye West, EST Gee and Kodak Black.

                DS2 (aka Dirty Sprite 2) is Future’s third studio album and the sequel to his 2011 breakout mixtape,
                Dirty Sprite. It dropped on July 17, 2015 and debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200, selling 151,000 copies

                The album was certified Platinum on June 8, 2016 by the RIAA.

                The album artwork is actually Shutterstock photo called “Ink swirling in water. Cloud of silky ink in
                water isolated on white background. Colorful ink in water, ink drop.” It was made by Slovenian artist
                Sanja Tošić. The FADER covered this story upon the album’s release.

                The first single off the album was “Fuck Up Some Commas,” which dropped on March 2, 2015. The other two
                singles from the album were “Where Ya At” and “Stick Talk.”

                HNDRXX is the sixth album by Atlanta rapper Future. It was announced by Future through social media &
                made available for pre-order almost a week after he dropped his fifth album, FUTURE, on the 17th of
                February, 2017.

                This project contains 17 tracks, similarly to the previous album, but this time it is not featureless;
                Future has decided to include features from Rihanna & The Weeknd.

                The album’s cover is the artist’s entire body, illustrating that this album reflects more on the body,
                soul, and emotions of Future and less about his ego. In contrast, “FUTURE” had an album cover only
                portraying his head, representing his ego which stemmed from being a rich and famous rapper and typical
                themes of trap music.

                Future is saying that he’s switching from the ‘banger’ trap music of “FUTURE” for a more melodic R&B
                sound for this album.

                On March 5, 2017, it was announced that with HNDRXX being the number one album in America on the
                Billboard charts the week of its release, Future became the first artist in history to have back-to-back
                number one debuts; FUTURE was released the prior week.
